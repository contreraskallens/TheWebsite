# Biography

Hey! I'm a Ph. D. Student at the Department of Psychology, Cornell University. I'm a member of the [Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://cnl.psych.cornell.edu) at Cornell University and the [Co-Mind Lab](http://co-mind.org/people.html) at the University of California, Los Angeles. My main research interests lie in the foundations of modern culturally-transformed human cognition, especially through symbol use, language and categorization. Having a background in Philosophy of Science, I'm also interested in data-driven exploration of scientific activity. I like to tackle these topics through a combination of theory-driven hypothesis formation and computational data analysis.
